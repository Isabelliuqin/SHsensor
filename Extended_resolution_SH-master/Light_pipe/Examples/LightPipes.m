% Examples of Optical Simulations with LightPipes:
%
% OneHole            - Diffraction of a field by a circular aperture.
% TwoHoles           - Two Holes Interferometer. (Young's experiment)
% Shear              - Shearing interferometer.
% Unstab             - Simulates an unstable resonator
% GaussRes           - Unstable laser resonator with a mirror with a (super)Gaussian reflection profile.
% Foclens            - Calculation of the intensity near the focus of a lens.
% Farfield           - Calculates the Fraunhofer diffraction of a round hole.
% TwymanGreen        - Twyman Green interferometer for studying phase aberrations.
% Michelson          - Michelson interferometer with a tilted mirror
% MichelsonMovie     - Makes a movie of a scanning Michelson interferometer
% ShowMichelsonMovie - Shows a previously recorded movie stored in MichelsonMovie.mat
% RadShear           - Radial shear interferometer demonstrating high order aberration.
% RotShear           - Rotational Shear interferometer with aberrated wavefront.
% Substrate          - Demostrates the use of LPReflectMultilayer to simulate substrate reflection.
% TwoSlits           - Simulation of two slits, one of them tilted.
% TwoSlitsWithDirectIntegration - Use of direct integration. WARNING: Takes long time!!
